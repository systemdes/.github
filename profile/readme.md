**vriOS** is the personal operating system by [@dandevri](#). Read about the philosophy and architecture behind it in [this post](#). It's difficult to label it directly, it's a knowledge base, a personal website, a blog, a portfolio, a design system and many more things.

**vriOS** consints of three core components:  
↳ Surface layer: the interface which acts as a public website  
↳ Data layer: all my content such as notes, posts and activity  
↳ System layer: foundational design philosophies and components
